# **L100 Design Pattern Series**  

This repository contains Java implementations of **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** design patterns.  
Each example demonstrates a **real-world scenario** to make understanding the patterns easier and more practical.

## **ðŸ“Œ Creational Design Patterns**  
Creational patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, improving **flexibility** and **reuse**.

### **1. Singleton Pattern â€” Unique ID Generator**  
Generates **unique IDs** using a **single instance** of the `UniqueIdService` across the application, ensuring **centralized ID management**.

### **2. Factory Pattern â€” Notification System**  
Uses a **NotificationFactory** to create objects like **Email**, **SMS**, and **Push** notifications without exposing creation logic, making the system **extensible**.

### **3. Abstract Factory Pattern â€” Theme-Based GUI**  
Creates families of related objects like **Buttons** and **Checkboxes** for **Light** and **Dark** themes using an abstract factory, keeping the design **scalable**.

### **4. Builder Pattern â€” Robot Construction**  
Constructs **complex robot objects** step by step with different builders (e.g., `HumanoidRobotBuilder`, `IndustrialRobotBuilder`), allowing **customization**.

### **5. Prototype Pattern â€” Game Character Cloning**  
Clones **game characters** like **Warrior** and **Mage** instead of recreating them, making object creation **faster** and **memory-efficient**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Structural Design Patterns**  
Structural patterns focus on **how classes and objects are combined** to form larger, efficient structures.

### **1. Adapter Pattern â€” Legacy Printer Integration**  
Bridges incompatible interfaces by using an **adapter**. The `OldPrinterAdapter` lets a legacy `OldPrinter` with `oldPrint()` work with `ModernPrinter.print()` seamlessly.

### **2. Bridge Pattern â€” Video Streaming Platform**  
Decouples **abstraction** (`StreamingPlatform`: Netflix, YouTube) from **implementation** (`StreamingQuality`: HD, SD), making the system **flexible** and avoiding class explosion.

### **3. Composite Pattern â€” File System Structure**  
Treats **files** and **folders** uniformly using a `FileSystemItem` interface, enabling recursive operations like **displaying contents** and **searching**.

### **4. Decorator Pattern â€” Coffee Shop Billing System**  
Dynamically adds features like **Milk**, **Sugar**, and **Cream** to a `SimpleCoffee` object without modifying the base class, ensuring **flexibility**.

### **5. Facade Pattern â€” Bank Account Creation**  
The `BankAccountFacade` acts as a **single entry point** to handle multiple services like `KYCVerifier`, `CreditCheck`, and `CardService`, simplifying the client interaction.

### **6. Flyweight Pattern â€” Car Rental System**  
Reuses shared `CarModel` objects for cars with the same specifications while maintaining unique details like **registration** and **rental duration**, optimizing **memory usage**.

### **7. Proxy Pattern â€” Office Internet Access Control**  
Controls internet access based on employee roles using a `ProxyInternetAccess` that decides whether to allow or deny requests, ensuring **secure resource usage**.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Behavioral Design Patterns**  
Behavioral patterns focus on **how objects communicate** and **delegate responsibilities**.

### **1. Template Method Pattern â€” Food Delivery System**  
Defines a **fixed algorithm** for ordering food (select restaurant â†’ place order â†’ payment â†’ delivery), while platforms like **Swiggy** and **Zomato** customize payment and delivery.

### **2. Mediator Pattern â€” Chat Room Communication**  
The `ChatRoomMediator` manages communication between users, ensuring they **donâ€™t interact directly**, reducing **tight coupling**.

### **3. Chain of Responsibility Pattern â€” IT Support Ticket System**  
Passes requests like **password resets** or **server issues** through multiple support levels until one resolves it, improving **flexibility in request handling**.

### **4. Observer Pattern â€” Smart Traffic Management System**  
The `TrafficController` (subject) notifies **ambulances**, **buses**, and **apps** (observers) whenever traffic conditions change, enabling **real-time updates**.

### **5. Strategy Pattern â€” Food Delivery Options**  
Chooses a **delivery strategy** (bike, car, drone) at runtime without modifying existing code, making the system **extensible and dynamic**.

### **6. Command Pattern â€” Remote Control System**  
Encapsulates **requests as objects**, allowing commands like **turning devices ON/OFF** to be queued, executed, or undone independently of the invoker.

### **7. State Pattern â€” Traffic Light System**  
Encapsulates states like **STOP**, **GO**, and **GET READY** into separate classes. The `TrafficLight` switches states dynamically, avoiding complex **if-else chains**.

### **8. Visitor Pattern â€” Hospital Billing System**  
Separates billing logic from services. The `BillingVisitor` calculates costs for objects like **Consultation**, **Surgery**, and **LabTest** without modifying their classes.

### **9. Interpreter Pattern â€” Smart Home Command System**  
Parses and executes commands like **"TURN ON LIGHT"**, **"TURN OFF FAN"**, and **"SET TEMPERATURE 24"**, translating human-readable instructions into actions.

### **10. Iterator Pattern â€” Music Playlist System**  
Provides an **iterator** to traverse songs in a playlist using `hasNext()` and `next()` without exposing the playlistâ€™s internal structure.

### **11. Memento Pattern â€” Text Editor Undo Feature**  
Stores previous states of the `TextEditor` in a stack (`History`) and restores them when the user performs an **undo**, enabling **version control**.
